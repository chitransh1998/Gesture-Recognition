# Hand Gesture Recognition
A Deep Learning based Hand Gesture Recognition Tool

## Introduction
Hand gestures are powerful human to human non-verbal form of communication conveying major part of information transfer in our everyday life.  
Hand gesture recognition is a process of understanding and classifying meaningful movements my human hands which can then be used to perform different tasks.

Here,an Artificial Neural Network is used to classify hand gestures using a self generated dataset and the model used is a Convolutional Neural network.

This model can be used in applications like Home Automation, Sign Language Interpretation, Gaming or unlocking smartphones etc. with requisite further additions to the pipeline.

## Vision v/s Hardware Methods

Earlier hardware based gesture recognition was more prevalent.User had to wear gloves helmet and other heavy apparatus which made the process difficult in real time environment.  
In contrast,vision based methods require only a camera,thus realizing a natural interaction between humans and computers without the use of any extra devices.  

## Dataset

The dataset currently contains a training and a test set, in which only four classes are there namely- * 
* Peace
* Punch
* Stop
* Thumbs_up    
There are 2000 (500*4) images in the training set and 320(80*4) images in the test set.  
Each image is resized to 200*200 and is taken from a webcam and stored in the respective directory.
